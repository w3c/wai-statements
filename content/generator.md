    title: Accessibility limitations
    singular: Accessibility limitation
    info: "There are many situations in which limitations to accessibility can occur. For example, you may not be able
    ensure instant accessibility of user-generated content. Providing transparency on such situations helps users to
    understand any issue they may be observing, and to find alternatives where applicable. Under the EU Web
    Accessibility Directive, public bodies are
    required to provide information on the parts of the content that do not conform, the reason for
    not conforming, and, if applicable, where to find accessible alternatives."
    label: "List the
    <em>content parts</em>
    that have accessibility limitations, a
    <em>description of the issue</em>
    that may be observed by users, a brief explanation of
    <em>why the issue occurs</em>, and

  # Compatibility with user environment
  user:
    title: Compatibility with user environment
    info: Despite best efforts, accessibility may not work well in every combination of operating system, web browser, and assistive technology. Developers typically test their websites and mobile applications with common user environments, to determine compatibility. WCAG defines requirements for accessibility features provided by content authors to be <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported">accessibility supported</a>. Communicating this compatibility expectation helps user to determine if that is the cause for any issues they may be observing.
    label: Describe the environments (combinations of web browsers, assistive technologies, and operating systems) that the content is expected to work with. These should be in-line with the  WCAG definition of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported">accessibility supported</a> use of technologies.
    enviroment:
      title: Environment
      example: "(Example: “browser X with assistive technology Y on operating system Z”)"
    add_button_text: Add another compatible environment
  # Known incompatibility
  incompatible:
    title: Known incompatibility
    info: Help users understand what versions of operating systems, web browsers, and assistive technologies are not (or no longer) supported. This helps user to determine if they can use your website or mobile application with their current environments.
    label: Describe the environments (combinations of web browsers, assistive technologies, and operating systems) that the content is not expected to work with.
    example: "(Example: “browsers older than 3 major versions” or “Mobile operating systems older than 5 years”)"
    add_button_text: Add another incompatible environment
  # Technologies Used
  technologies:
    title: Technologies used
    info: You may be relying on specific web technologies, such as JavaScript, WAI-ARIA, or SVG to ensure accessibility of your content. Communicating this expectation in the accessibility statement can help users to understand the reason for issues they may be observing. For example, the accessibility features may not work because the user disabled JavaScript. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc4">WCAG 2 conformance requirement 4</a> on "<em>accessibility supported was of using technologies relied upon</em>" provides more background.
    label: Describe the technologies that are relied upon for conformance. The content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported.

  # Assessment approach
  assessment:
    title: Assessment approach
    info: How did you assess your website or mobile application, to determine the information provided in the previous sections? This helps users understand your quality assurance process and the background for the claims you make in your accessibility statement.
    self:
      title: Self-evaluation
      meaning: the content was evaluated by your own organization or the developer of the content
    external: 
      title: External evaluation
      meaning: the content was evaluated by an external entity not involved in the design and development process

    other_example: "(Example: a formal quality assurance process throughout the design and development process)"
    add_button_text: Add another approach
  # Related evidence
  evidence:
    title: Related evidence
    info: Provide links to related background and evidence to support the claims you make in this accessibility, and to provide more transparency and credibility. This can include an evaluation report, an evaluation statement, or a certification.
    report:
      title: Link to recent evaluation report
      info: An evaluation report provides details on which accessibility requirements are met, and which are not. While this is usually more technical of nature than the average user, it can help some users to understand issues they have been observing. You can use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/">WCAG-EM Evaluation Report Tool</a> to create an evaluation report. Place the link to the report here.
      example: "(Example: “https://example.org/accessibility-evaulation-report”)"
    statement:
      title: Link to evaluation statement
      info: An evaluation statement summarizes the essential outcomes of an evaluation report. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/">Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM)</a> defines requirements for evaluation statements in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/#step5c">Step 5.c</a> of the document. This can be provided instead of or in addition to an evaluation report provided above.
      example: "(Example: “https://example.org/accessibility-evaulation-statement”)"

The  <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj">EU Web Accessibility Directive </a> foresees EU countries to have legal “enforcement procedures” when users are not satisfied with the responses from public bodies. Inform users about any such formal complaints procedures. This may also motivate them to provide you with valuable feedback about the accessibility of your content. <br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “We aim to respond to accessibility feedback within 2 business days, and to propose a solution within 10 business days.  entity], should you be dissatisfied with our response to you.”'
